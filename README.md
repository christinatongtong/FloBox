## What is FlowBox?
FlowBox helps users find nearby menstrual product dispensers, see live availability, and navigate quickly via a map or list view.

### Demo
- App walkthrough: (add a GIF or link to a short video demo)
- Screens:
  - Map view: pins colored by availability
  - List view: distance, pads/tampons counts
  - Scanner: scan to report or interact with a dispenser

### Tech Stack
- Expo + React Native
- Expo Router (tabs + file-based routing)
- react-native-maps (MapView, markers)
- expo-camera (scanner)
- TypeScript
- Vector Icons: @expo/vector-icons (MaterialCommunityIcons)

### Key Features
- Real-time inventory updates
- Search and filter (All/Pads/Tampons)
- Distance calculation and sorting

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
